    <h3>Lobster Themidor</h3>
    <p> Lobster themidor is a French dish consisting 
        of diced lobster meat stuffed into <br> lobster shell, 
        topped with a buttery wine sauce, sprinkled with cheese, 
        and broiled. <br> The iconic dish gets its name from a popular 
        1891 play called Thermidor by Victorien Sardou. <br>
